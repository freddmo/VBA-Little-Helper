# VBA-Little-Helper

## Motivation
Wheter is good or bad, most time comsumption comes from repetitive tasks rather than unexcpectance situations.
I wanted to find a way where I can reduce the weight of my coworker and me from doing +20 Proformas each day and focus our energy on bigger tasks. Even if it is only some seconds... it helps to reduce the burden of wasting time.

## Problems along the way and How I faced it?
I had experience coding in python or R only for analytics purpose but never on excel or any other program to build a "software" no matter if it was bad or not.
  - I learned that it was not neccesary  a strong programming language to help my coworkers. So I set minutes in my free time and after work to sketch, develop, and test ways to help. I talked directly with my coworkers to uderstand his problems and what he was looking for. Furthermore, each 2 days I check with him to obtaing his approve or show him workaround of the solution.

## Problems and How the "software" has helped.
It's purpose is to:
- Reduce time when creating Pro-formas.
  - 2:13 minutes when to 1.27s in the best case scenario for the old way of doing Pro-formas
- Eliminate the repetitive task of labeling new Pro-formas.
  - Before you have to label the pdf with the name of the hospital.
- Replace a bulky excel file
  - Now Only pdf files are created instead of expanding the excel sheet. 
- Reduce the error of creating Proformas such as incorrect label or wrong format.
  - Before you ahve to adjut to copy a previously made format with its images and it distortioned the proforma.


##Set-up 

## Future plans
The "software" now runs in excel as I previously stated but, currently I am working on a JAVA version to display
a cleaner, and faster program.
