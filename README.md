## Motivation 
I do +20 Pro-Forma everyday. At the beginning, it took 2 to 3 minutes to do every pro-forma and involved to much steps causing me mental tireness affecting my performance in other tasks. I wanted a faster, simple mini program to create files and share it with my coworkers in a familiar space. 

## Problems along the way and How I faced it?
Problem: No programming experience(related to build something instead of analysis)
- Solution: Asking the right questions on Stackoverflow and Googgle lead me to build piece by piece the whole program.

## Topics the mini Program has helped.
- Time reduction
  - Usual 2:30 minutes creating Pro-forma is reduced 1.27s
- Correct and Consistent label
  - The mini program creates a standard pdf filename detailing the file code, receiver, and pro-forma #.
- Lighter Excel File
  - There is only one page with a generic static design. All records are saved as pdf and MYSQL records. 



##Set-up 

## Future plans 
 - Until we get a New software from a known software company in the Pharmaceutical industry I plan to move the program from excel to Java.
  ### Reasons
    - excel is too old to be compatible with other programs and that reduce the options when creating new features.
    - VBA macros buttons are slow, and more if within the sheet and not in a user form.
    - Better design customization.
